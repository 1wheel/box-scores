Ideas

Hawks haven't had a player score more than 30 points this season. They went on a 7 game winning stream with 7 different players scoring the most posts. Has there ever been an offense so balanced. 

Degrees of Duncan - how many teammates has he had? Who has the most/least per game played? Which duo/trio of of players has played togeather the most/had the best record

Only 6 players averaged over 36+min a game this season v. 47 who did so 8 years ago. Is this trend towards managed minutes happening in other professional sports? Why?
